## 📁 Folder Structure

Solutions are organized by **year → month → problem file**.  
Example: `2025/July/23-make-fancy-string.cpp`

## 📌 Notes

- All problems are solved in **C++**.
- File names follow this pattern: `DD-problem-name.cpp` inside the appropriate month.
- Goal is consistency, not difficulty. Even one problem a day keeps the momentum going!
